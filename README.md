# Electric Vehicle Registration in Washington State
## This is an analysis of data provided by Washington State (data.wa.gov) that includes vehicle registrations for electric vehicles dating back to 2010.

## Analysis has been completed using Malloy, A modern open source language for analyzing, transforming, and modeling data. Further analyis can be complete via github by following the instructions at the end of this document.

## Motivation
The initial motivation for this analysis is to find and answer interesting questions that present themselves through the data available in the sources. This will increase the skill and ability of Malloy while giving insight to the state of electric vehicle registrations in Washington State. 

## Summary of Findings
- **Trends Over Time**: Analysis of EV registrations in WA show that over the last 15 years, there has been significant increase in registration of new EV. With only two years of negative growth (2015 and 2019 at -10% and -6% respectively.
- **Hotspots**: With county information included, the information matched what many washingtonians may hypothesize, King County had an overwelmingly large portion of EV registrations.


## Preview of Analysis
#### 1. Electric Vehicle sales have continued to have significant increases year over year outside of pandemic declines and a down year in 2015. Through additional online searches, I could not determine a single reason behind the 2015 decline.

#### 2. While year over year statistics look great for almost all Makers, the volume of the top Makers move them even further ahead of their competitors (e.g with simliar YoY increases, Tesla has almost 10x vehicles registered than Kia)

#### 3. King county claims the majority of new EV registrations while other large counties follow their lead in adoption.

#### 4. When looking at rates on a county basis, you can see that while the volume is different, the trends accross counties are very similar.

## Conclusion
While the motivation of this work was mainly for educational and exploratory reasons, the data still drew some conclusions about EV's in Washington state. Through the graphics provided above, you can conclude that EV sales will continue to increase, that other Makers besides Tesla will likely continue to increase sales, and that there are likely some makers that will decrease as shown in some but not all recent years of data.
